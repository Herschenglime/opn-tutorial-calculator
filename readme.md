Start a web server in the folder where index.html is located with the help of npm or python.

npm:
Install http-server with npm `npm install --global http-server`
Start a web-server `http-server type/a/path/here`
It will start the server in port 8080
http://localhost:8080/index.html  (shows a blank page)

python:
`python3 -m http.server`
It will start the server in port 8000
http://localhost:8000/index.html  (shows a blank page)
